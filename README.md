## üìñ  Revalida

The **Revalida** (National Examination for the Revalidation of Medical Diplomas) is a Brazilian assessment designed to validate medical degrees obtained abroad. It is aimed at both foreign-trained doctors and Brazilian nationals who have studied medicine outside the country and wish to practise in Brazil. The exam ensures that candidates possess the necessary knowledge, skills, and competencies required for medical practice in Brazil.

The **Revalida** consists of two distinct phases:
1. **Written Examination** ‚Äì This stage evaluates theoretical knowledge through multiple-choice and discursive questions.
2. **Clinical Skills Assessment** ‚Äì Candidates must demonstrate practical medical competencies in simulated clinical scenarios.

To participate, applicants must meet specific requirements, including legal residency in Brazil and submission of authenticated academic documents. The exam is conducted twice a year and is now the **sole method** for revalidating foreign medical diplomas in Brazil.

Available exam repositories include assessments from **2017.01, 2017.02, 2020.01, 2020.02, 2021.01, 2022.01, 2022.02, 2023.01, 2023.02, and 2024.01**.

## üõ† Fine-tuning BERT-based Models

We use two BERT-based models pre-trained in Brazilian Portuguese, namely, BERTimbau Base (BERT-Base) and BERTimbau Large (BERT-Large) from <a href="https://github.com/neuralmind-ai/portuguese-bert/"><strong>BERTimbau - Portuguese BERT</strong></a>.  The third model was the <a href="https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md"><strong>BERT multilingual base</strong></a>. 

The AdamW optimizer was used to adjust parameters in the model, batch size of 16, configured with a learning rate equal to 2e-6 in seven training epochs. K-fold cross-validation was performed by dividing the pre-processed dataset into 80% for training and 20% for validation.
