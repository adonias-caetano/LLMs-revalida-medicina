## üìñ  Revalida

The **Revalida** (National Examination for the Revalidation of Medical Diplomas) is a Brazilian assessment designed to validate medical degrees obtained abroad. It is aimed at both foreign-trained doctors and Brazilian nationals who have studied medicine outside the country and wish to practise in Brazil. The exam ensures that candidates possess the necessary knowledge, skills, and competencies required for medical practice in Brazil.

The **Revalida** consists of two distinct phases:
1. **Written Examination** ‚Äì This stage evaluates theoretical knowledge through multiple-choice and discursive questions.
2. **Clinical Skills Assessment** ‚Äì Candidates must demonstrate practical medical competencies in simulated clinical scenarios.

To participate, applicants must meet specific requirements, including legal residency in Brazil and submission of authenticated academic documents. The exam is conducted twice a year and is now the **sole method** for revalidating foreign medical diplomas in Brazil.

Available exam repositories include assessments from **2017.01, 2017.02, 2020.01, 2020.02, 2021.01, 2022.01, 2022.02, 2023.01, 2023.02, and 2024.01**.

## üõ† Colab Scripts

This repository contains various folders related to the study of LLMs and data visualisation:

- **codes**: Colab scripts for running models such as LLama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and GPT-4o and Colab scripts for generating bar charts and boxplots using R, with a fallback option included.  
- **answers**: A collection of responses generated by all the LLMs involved in the study.  
- **exams**: Contains all the questions from Revalida exams spanning from 2017.01 to 2024.01.
